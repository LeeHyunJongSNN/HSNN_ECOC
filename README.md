# Fault tolerant Hybrid Spiking Neural Network architecture based on Error Correction Output Code (ECOC)
We develop fault tolerant SNN architecture merged with Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) using ECOC (sdnn_cifar, sdnn_mnist, sdnn_agnews)
Our novel SNN architecture is oriented by wireless communication and the architecture shows higher performances than the baseline and benchmarks when there are faults in neural networks.
Different from conventional ECOC-based neural networks, ours use multi-code and it uses additional binary code to decode multi-code from output perceptrons.
This method declines loss values dramatically when the network is affected by faults severely.
